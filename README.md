This is a dist branch that represents the distributable build for the branch https://github.com/shobhitg/mapbox-gl-js/tree/cruise/mapbox-gl-stretch-1.2.0 (Latest commit: https://github.com/shobhitg/mapbox-gl-js/commit/f92aca41d93444ce4ae63449a8ba89877f9acb5b).

`cruise/mapbox-gl-stretch-1.2.0` branch is rebased to Mapbox 1.2.0 version, and has one additional commit on top to add the `raster-stretch-minmax` feature which is added via this commit https://github.com/shobhitg/mapbox-gl-js/commit/f92aca41d93444ce4ae63449a8ba89877f9acb5b.

We will treat both `cruise/mapbox-gl-stretch-1.2.0` and `cruise/mapbox-gl-stretch-1.2.0-dist` branches as readonly/frozen branches.

Except for changes in Readme.md, if for any reason we need to make any additional change in future, then we will make new branches to incorporate those changes.
